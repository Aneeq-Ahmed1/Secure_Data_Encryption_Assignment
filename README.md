🛡️ Secure Data Encryption System Using Streamlit
🔗 Live Demo
Try it here 👉 Secure Data App (Streamlit)

📌 Overview
This is a secure data encryption and decryption system built using Python and Streamlit. It allows users to:

Store their data securely with a unique passkey

Retrieve the encrypted data using the correct passkey

Automatically block access and require reauthentication after multiple failed attempts

No external database is used — everything is managed in in-memory storage during the app session.

🔐 Key Features
🧠 Fernet Encryption for strong data protection

🔐 SHA-256 Hashed Passkeys for security

⛔ 3-Failed Attempts Lock with reauthorization via Login

🎛️ Streamlit UI with colorful interface and dark/light mode toggle

💾 In-memory storage (no files or databases involved)

🚀 How It Works
✅ Store Data
Go to Store Data section

Enter any text and a secure passkey

Data is encrypted and saved in memory

🔍 Retrieve Data
Go to Retrieve Data

Paste encrypted data and enter the correct passkey

Data is decrypted if passkey is valid

After 3 incorrect attempts, you're forced to Login again

🔑 Login Page
Enter the master password (admin123 by default) to reset access after failed attempts.

💻 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Streamlit

Cryptography (Fernet)

Hashlib (SHA-256)

🔐 Security Notes
This is a demo-level project and should not be used for production security storage.

For production, use PBKDF2 hashing, database storage, and encryption key rotation.
